# Cocid-19 Emergency Patients

## Problem
with the outbreak of covid-19, medical facilities have been stretched to the limit in their ability to handle the large cases of patients coming in on a daily basis. The need to be able to plan for patient stay has become imperative as both human and material resources have been stretched thin. This hospital is looking to be able to know how long a patient is going to stay in other to effectively manage bed space allocation, nurses and doctor shift as well as other hospital resources.

## Solution
I built a model using historical data of the Coivid-19 patients that have come into the hospital, their health characteristics like, blood pressusre, temperature, diabetics history amongs many other indictors and built a model to be able to predict the lengt of stay of patients.
